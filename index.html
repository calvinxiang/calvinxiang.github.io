                                                    Leaders Collective is one of two largest clubs at my school, along side the student council club. In LC, I am apart of the promotions committee, more specifically I am a lead video editor who edits all the videos that the school releases. 
                                                    Some examples of edits I have done include videos for assemblies, open houses and in school events.

                                                    This is one of my favourite clubs, but I do not necessarily join all the meetings, as most of the meetings are teaching math concepts which I already know. The part that makes this club enjoyable for me
                                                    is the people in it. We often share many math concept ideas, as well as take up hard contest problems, which always facinates me.
